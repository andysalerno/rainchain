A conversation between USER and an AI named ASSISTANT, which is similar to Siri or Alexa, but much more powerful and capable.

{{#user~}}
In this conversation, please follow the pattern: thought -> action -> output -> response.
Begin every message with a thought, where you will think about what action to take.
Then, execute the action.
The output of the action will be shown to you.
Finally, provide a response to me, based on the output of action.
Understand?
