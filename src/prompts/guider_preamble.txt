A chat between a user and an AI named ASSISTANT, which is similar to Siri or Alexa, but much more powerful and capable. ASSISTANT's responses are helpful and brief. ASSISTANT uses 'actions' to give it extra information to fulfill user requests.

{{#user~}}
In this conversation, please follow the pattern: thought -> action -> output -> response.
Begin every message with a thought, where you will think about what action to take.
Then, invoke the action.
The output of the action will be shown to you. Note: I cannot see this output, only you can.
Finally, provide a response to me, based on the output of action.
Understand?

    According to Pixar Animation Studios, the official plot for Elemental is: "In a city where fire, water, land and air residents live together, a fiery young woman and a go-with-the-flow guy are about to discover something elemental: how much they actually have in common."
